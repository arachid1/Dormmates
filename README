Matt Kim and I have worked on this roommate finding application designed for college students by college students Through the Summer and Fall 2018.
We aim to implement this platform at the Johns Hopkins University. 

The goal is to provide a better user experience than the traditional matching system used by the school.
We truly believe that a good roommate experience can substantially impact your college experience and help you be more successful in the long-run.
